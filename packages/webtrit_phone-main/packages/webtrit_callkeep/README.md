# Webtrit CallKeep

**Webtrit CallKeep** is a Flutter plugin that integrates native calling UI on iOS (CallKit) and Android (
ConnectionService). It allows your VoIP/WebRTC app to display incoming/outgoing calls using the device’s system UI —
even when your app is in the background or terminated.

> **Note**: CallKit is banned in the China App Store. For distribution in China, consider using an alternative mechanism
> such as standard local notifications with sound.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Incoming Call UI**\
  – On iOS, the system CallKit UI is shown when the app is locked or in the background. When the app is in the
  foreground, a Flutter-based incoming call screen is used instead.\
  – On Android, all incoming calls are displayed using a Flutter UI combined with the standard push notification
  interface — native ConnectionService UI is not used.

- **Background Handling**\
  – On iOS, background incoming calls are handled via CallKit and PushKit.\
  – On Android, background call handling is supported either via persistent signaling services or triggered by push
  notifications (e.g., FCM).

- **Incoming & Outgoing Calls**\
  – Full support for both call directions

- **Call Controls**\
  – Answer, decline, mute, hold, and dial pad (DTMF), with delegate event handling

## 📱 Platform Support

| Platform | Minimum |
|----------|---------|
| Android  | SDK 26+ |
| iOS      | iOS 11+ |

---

## 🔧 Installation

Add the plugin in your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  webtrit_callkeep: ^latest_version
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Initialization (Main Isolate)

```dart
await _callkeep.setUp(
  CallkeepOptions(
    ios: CallkeepIOSOptions(
      localizedName: context.read<PackageInfo>().appName,
      ringtoneSound: Assets.ringtones.incomingCall1,
      ringbackSound: Assets.ringtones.outgoingCall1,
      iconTemplateImageAssetName: Assets.callkeep.iosIconTemplateImage.path,
      maximumCallGroups: 13,
      maximumCallsPerCallGroup: 13,
      supportedHandleTypes: const {CallkeepHandleType.number},
    ),
    android: CallkeepAndroidOptions(
      ringtoneSound: Assets.ringtones.incomingCall1,
      ringbackSound: Assets.ringtones.outgoingCall1,
    ),
  ),
);
```

### Setting Delegates

The plugin allows you to register delegate classes to handle call-related events.

```dart
Callkeep().setDelegate(MyCallkeepDelegate());
Callkeep().setPushRegistryDelegate(MyPushRegistryDelegate()); // iOS only
```

- `setDelegate(...)`: Listen to call events (incoming, answered, ended, etc.) entirely on the Flutter side.
- `setPushRegistryDelegate(...)`: Handle PushKit VoIP push events on iOS only.

---

### Receiving Incoming Call

```dart
await Callkeep().reportNewIncomingCall(
  callId,
  CallkeepHandle.number('+123456789'),
  displayName: 'Caller Name',
  hasVideo: false,
);
```

### Starting Outgoing Call

```dart
await Callkeep().startCall(
  'outgoing-id',
  CallkeepHandle.number('+987654321'),
  displayNameOrContactIdentifier: 'Jane Doe',
  hasVideo: true,
);
```

## 📩 SMS-triggered Incoming Call (Regex-based)

Webtrit CallKeep supports triggering an incoming call via specially formatted SMS messages. This is useful for
white-label apps that need to handle calls even when push notifications are unavailable.

### When to Use

* When push delivery is unreliable (e.g., in background-restricted environments)
* When SMS can serve as a fallback mechanism to notify of incoming calls

### How It Works

* he SMS is parsed on the Android side using a regular expression (regex) provided from Flutter. The message must begin
  with a strict prefix '<#> WEBTRIT:', which is used to filter only trusted SMS messages originating from your backend.
  This prefix is essential for security and must be retained to help pass Play Store review for sensitive SMS
  permissions.
* If the regex matches a predefined structure and captures all required fields, the call is triggered via
  `PhoneConnectionService`

### Android Permissions Required

* `RECEIVE_SMS`
* `BROADCAST_SMS` (used for `SmsReceiver`)
* Additional runtime permissions for SMS reception may be needed

> ⚠️ **Important**: SMS access is considered a sensitive permission in the Play Store. You must justify its use and
> clearly describe the flow (i.e., receiving formatted SMS to trigger VoIP calls). The regex must only match SMS from
> your
> backend service.

### Regex Requirements

You must define a valid ICU-compatible regex that extracts 4 fields in the expected order:

1. `callId`
2. `handle`
3. `displayName` (URL-encoded if needed)
4. `hasVideo` (`true` or `false`)

Regex pattern and full requirements are described in this document:

👉 **[Regex Requirements for SMS Triggering](docs/sms_trigger_regex_requirements.md)**

### Sample ADB SMS Command

```bash
adb emu sms send 5554 '<#> CALLHOME: {"type":"incoming","handle":"380971112233","callID":"abc123","displayName":"John%20Doe","hasVideo":true} Do not share.'
```

## 🔄 Event Communication Between Flutter and Platform

Webtrit CallKeep provides a robust two-way communication system between the Flutter layer and native platforms (iOS and
Android), inspired by the CallKit design on iOS.

---

### 📤 Events Sent from Flutter to Platform

The following methods are used to **notify the native platform** about call actions or state changes. These are
typically used to **trigger UI** (e.g., incoming screen), report call status, or request platform-level operations.

| Method                              | Description                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reportNewIncomingCall(...)`        | Triggers the native UI to display an incoming call.                                 |
| `reportConnectingOutgoingCall(...)` | Reports that an outgoing call is connecting.                                        |
| `reportConnectedOutgoingCall(...)`  | Reports that an outgoing call is connected.                                         |
| `reportUpdateCall(...)`             | Sends updated call metadata such as display name, video, or proximity sensor usage. |
| `reportEndCall(...)`                | Notifies the platform that a call has ended with a reason.                          |
| `startCall(...)`                    | Starts an outgoing call via native UI.                                              |
| `answerCall(...)`                   | Answers a call from Flutter code.                                                   |
| `endCall(...)`                      | Ends the call from Flutter.                                                         |
| `setHeld(...)`                      | Puts the call on hold or resumes it.                                                |
| `setMuted(...)`                     | Mutes or unmutes the call.                                                          |
| `sendDTMF(...)`                     | Sends a DTMF tone.                                                                  |
| `setSpeaker(...)`                   | Enables or disables speaker mode.                                                   |

---

### 📥 `perform*` Events Received from Platform

These methods are called from the **native platform back to Flutter** when a user interacts with the system’s call UI (
e.g., answering a call from lock screen) or when system-level events occur (e.g., audio session activation).

Implement these by providing a `CallkeepDelegate` via `Callkeep().setDelegate(...)`.

| Method                         | Triggered When...                                                          |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `continueStartCallIntent(...)` | System confirms outgoing call intent (e.g., from Siri or Call UI).         |
| `didPushIncomingCall(...)`     | System has received and processed an incoming call.                        |
| `performStartCall(...)`        | User initiates an outgoing call from native UI.                            |
| `performAnswerCall(...)`       | User answers the call from native UI.                                      |
| `performEndCall(...)`          | User ends the call from system UI.                                         |
| `performSetHeld(...)`          | User toggles hold/resume from system UI.                                   |
| `performSetMuted(...)`         | User toggles mute from system UI.                                          |
| `performSendDTMF(...)`         | User sends DTMF digits from the native dial pad.                           |
| `performSetSpeaker(...)`       | User enables/disables speaker from system UI.                              |
| `didActivateAudioSession()`    | System has activated the audio session (important for audio routing).      |
| `didDeactivateAudioSession()`  | System has deactivated the audio session.                                  |
| `didReset()`                   | System resets the call state, often due to errors or forceful termination. |

> 🧐 **Note**: `perform*` methods usually require you to respond asynchronously (e.g., via signaling servers) and return
> a `bool` indicating success or failure. Failing to respond may result in incorrect UI behavior or system timeouts.

### Example: `startCall` ➝ `performStartCall`

Below is a simplified lifecycle flow illustrating how an outgoing call is initiated and processed using
`Callkeep.startCall` followed by a native event triggering `performStartCall`:

```dart
// Triggered by your Flutter app logic
final callId = WebtritSignalingClient.generateCallId();
final handle = CallkeepHandle.number('+123456789');
await callkeep.startCall(
  callId,
  handle,
  displayNameOrContactIdentifier: 'John Doe',
  hasVideo: false,
);
```

This will attempt to establish a new connection and validate it. If the connection is successfully created and valid,
the system will invoke `performStartCall` to proceed with the call setup.

If the connection is valid, the system will call the following delegate method:

```dart
@override
Future<bool> performStartCall(
  String callId,
  CallkeepHandle handle,
  String? displayNameOrContactIdentifier,
  bool video,
) async {
  // Establish media connection and signaling offer
  final stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({'audio': true});
  final peerConnection = await createPeerConnection({...});
  final offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();

  await _signalingClient.send(OutgoingCallRequest(
    callId: callId,
    number: handle.normalizedValue(),
    jsep: offer.toMap(),
  ));

  await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
  return true;
}
```

You are expected to:

1. Initialize media stream
2. Create WebRTC offer
3. Send offer to your signaling server
4. Set local description on the peer connection

If everything succeeds, return `true`. If anything fails, return `false` and CallKeep will automatically terminate the
native call screen.

---

You can add similar flows for `answerCall`, `endCall`, etc.

## ⚙️ Android Background Modes

Webtrit CallKeep offers two modes to handle background call signaling in Android. Use the one that suits your scenario.

> 🔎 **Note**: Some Android classes use the `@Keep` annotation to prevent code shrinking and obfuscation. Ensure
> ProGuard/R8 rules preserve these classes.

---

### ♻️ 1. Push Notification Isolate (One-time)

Ideal for apps that **do not maintain a persistent connection** and instead rely on push notifications to trigger call
events.

#### Setup

Configure the push notification isolate with the following code (Optional):

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.configurePushNotificationSignalingService(launchBackgroundIsolateEvenIfAppIsOpen: false);
```

Initialize the push notification isolate callback.
This callback will be triggered when
`AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.reportNewIncomingCall` is called, for example, from
an FCM isolate.

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.initializeCallback(onPushNotificationSyncCallback););
```

#### Triggering Incoming Call from FCM or Another Isolate

You can notify the plugin of a new incoming call from within a background handler (e.g., FCM):

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> _firebaseMessagingBackgroundHandler(RemoteMessage message) async {
  AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundPushNotificationBootstrapService.reportNewIncomingCall(
    appNotification.call.id,
    CallkeepHandle.number(appNotification.call.handle),
    displayName: appNotification.call.displayName,
    hasVideo: appNotification.call.hasVideo,
  );
}
```

#### Initialize push notification callback

To manage resources and synchronize signaling from push notifications, implement a background callback like this:

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> onPushNotificationCallback(CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus status) async {
  await _initializeDependencies();

  switch (status) {
    case CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus.synchronizeCallStatus:
      await _backgroundCallEventManager?.onStart();
      break;
    case CallkeepPushNotificationSyncStatus.releaseResources:
      await _backgroundCallEventManager?.close();
      break;
  }
}
```

Inside this isolate, when a connection is established, we can communicate with the native part using
`BackgroundPushNotificationServicee`. This service provides methods for `endBackgroundCall`, and
`endAllBackgroundCalls`. Additionally, you can set a delegate using `setBackgroundServiceDelegate` to listen for events
such as `performServiceAnswerCall`, `performServiceEndCall`, and `endCallReceived`.

```dart
class SignalingForegroundIsolateManager implements CallkeepBackgroundServiceDelegate {
  @override
  void performServiceAnswerCall(String callId) async {
    if (!(await _signalingManager.hasNetworkConnection())) {
      throw Exception('No connection');
    }
    // Proceed with answering
  }

  @override
  void performServiceEndCall(String callId) async {
    await _signalingManager.declineCall(callId);
  }

  void anwserCall(String callId) {
    BackgroundPushNotificationServicee.answerCall(callId);
  }
}
```

This ensures your app can rehydrate or tear down background services based on the nature of the push event.

---

### 🔌 2. Background Signaling Isolate (Persistent)

Used for always-on signaling, even in the background.

#### Setup

Configure the signaling isolate and set up the notification details for the foreground service(Optional).

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.setUp(androidNotificationName: "WebTrit Inbound Calls",androidNotificationDescription: "This is required to receive incoming calls",);
```

Initialize the isolate callback for background signaling. This callback will be triggered when the status of the main
isolate changes, the app lifecycle changes, or the isolate starts:

```dart
AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.initializeCallback(onSignalingSyncCallback);
```

#### Start and stop the foreground signaling service from the main isolate:

```dart
await AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.startService();
await AndroidCallkeepServices.backgroundSignalingBootstrapService.stopService();
```

#### Initialize signaling callback

Register the callback that will be triggered to manage the signaling connection.
This can be done using the `CallkeepLifecycleEvent` from `CallkeepServiceStatus`, which contains parameters such as the
current activity status (e.g., opened or closed) and the `CallkeepSignalingStatus` from `CallkeepServiceStatus`,
indicating the current signaling status if provided by the main isolate; otherwise, it will be null.

```dart
@pragma('vm:entry-point')
Future<void> onSignalingSyncCallback(CallkeepServiceStatus status) async {
  await _initializeDependencies();

  await _signalingForegroundIsolateManager?.sync(status);
  
  return;
}

```

Inside this isolate, when a connection is established, we can communicate with the native part using
`BackgroundSignalingService`. This service provides methods for `incomingCall`, `endBackgroundCall`, and
`endAllBackgroundCalls`. Additionally, you can set a delegate using `setBackgroundServiceDelegate` to listen for events
such as `performServiceAnswerCall`, `performServiceEndCall`, and `endCallReceived`.

```dart
class SignalingForegroundIsolateManager implements CallkeepBackgroundServiceDelegate {
  @override
  void performServiceAnswerCall(String callId) async {
    if (!(await _signalingManager.hasNetworkConnection())) {
      throw Exception('No connection');
    }
    // Proceed with answering
  }

  @override
  void performServiceEndCall(String callId) async {
    await _signalingManager.declineCall(callId);
  }
  
  void anwserCall(String callId) {
    BackgroundSignalingService.answerCall(callId);
  }
}
```
